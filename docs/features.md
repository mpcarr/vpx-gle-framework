## Game Logic Devices

A well designed Virtual Pinball table contains many of the real world devices such as scoops, vuks (vertical up kickers), plungers, diverters, drop targets e.t.c. These devices are machine wide devices that need to respond to the ball interacting with them. The classes found in the framework mimic these device behaviours by monitoring and dispatching events which other parts of the system can respond to.
